Instructions: Code will take a long time to return an output to StreamLit (except a minimum of 30 minutes). 

Prompt is not needed. Visual input with boxes are provided in StreamLit to enter events.

Limitations: System will not properly fill out events by end of the week due to token issues.

Documentation Statement: Utilized ChatGPT to write implementation code and suggest ideas. (https://chatgpt.com/share/6933d6f9-c498-8004-b1f9-9ebb4c29c2cd).
